I needed one spot for all my resources.

## General CSS Snippets
  - [30 Seconds of Code](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/css/p/1)
    - The CSS snippet collection contains utilities and interactive examples for CSS3. It includes modern techniques for creating commonly-used layouts, styling and animating elements, as well as snippets for handling user interactions.

## Animations / Hovers / Spinners
  - [Animate CSS](https://animate.style/)
    - Animate.css is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and attention-guiding hints.
  - [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - A collection of CSS3 powered hover effects to be applied to links, buttons, logos, SVG, featured images and so on. Easily apply to your own elements, modify or just use for inspiration. Available in CSS, Sass, and LESS.
  - [SpinKit](https://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/)
    - Simple loading spinners animated with CSS. See demo. SpinKit only uses (transform and opacity) CSS animations to create smooth and easily customizable animations.

## Resets / Normalize
  - [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
    - Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
  - [Josh Comeau's CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
    - Like other CSS resets, it's unopinionated when it comes to design / cosmetics. You can use this reset for any project, no matter the aesthetic you're going for.
  - [Picalilli CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/)
    - "In this modern era of web development, we donâ€™t really need a heavy-handed reset, or even a reset at all, because CSS browser compatibility issues are much less likely than they were in the old IE 6 days. That era was when resets such as normalize.css came about and saved us all heaps of hell. Those days are gone now and we can trust our browsers to behave more, so I think resets like that are probably mostly redundant."
